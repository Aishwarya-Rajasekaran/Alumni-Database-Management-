ALUMNI DATABASE –IIITD&M KANCHEEPURAM


The aim of this database is to build an alumni network in the college so that the Institute/Students can stay in touch with the
alumni. 
The Alumni Association plays an important role in helping to shape the future of our Institute by representing the views of its
members and contributing to building an engaged and supportive alumni community. Its influence and activities are pivotal in the 
development of the experience of IIITD&M’s students today.



	Who are the clients?

1. Institute: Keeps track of the alumni network.  
2. Students - Should have access to the following details of the alumni: Name, email id, their work, and internship.
3. Alumni - Can update their personal information, view personal details of other alumni, the company they are working for,
            or the university in which they’re studying.

The database stores personal information of the alumni like their name, contact number (maximum of two), residential address 
  and email id. An alumnus is uniquely identified by his/her email id.


The college records consisting of roll number, CGPA, degree, department, year of graduation and project title along with 
  their mentor are documented, where the roll number uniquely identifies the alumnus. 
An alumnus could have been a part no more than 1 department during the course in the college. No change can be done to these by
  the alumni. 

If the alumnus is placed, details regarding their work like name of the company, location and designation are recorded. 
  An alumnus can work at more than one job at the same time. In that case, each record is uniquely identified by the alumni
  email-id and name of company jointly. 

If the alumnus is pursuing higher studies, then the name of the University in which they’re studying, its location, degree, 
  stream they’ve chosen and the year of completion are recorded. An alumnus may also be pursuing higher studies and at the same
  time be working at a job (part-time). An alumnus can however only be part of one University at a time.


Miscellaneous information like the internships and mini projects they had done before graduating (Area of interest and Institute
  /Industry from/in which it was done)  and the professional contacts they have is also stored in the database so that the students
  can contact the alumni that had done projects of their interest or get informational interviews from their contacts. Any alumnus 
  could have been a part of minimum 0 and maximum 8 internships.
